    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p id="limit">My name is Dallin Snell. My dad has been in the United States military for my entire life. Because of that, I haven't lived in one place longer than three to four years. I am currently studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University-Idaho in Rexburg, Idaho. Even though I've lived all over the country, I claim Alabama as my home.</p>
    <p id="limit">In 2016, my brother and I (in the picture, I'm the handsome one on the left) took a trip to South Dakota to see my grandparents. This picture, however, was of us halfway in Clinton, Missouri.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <h4>TV</h4>
    <p id="limit">I've had a revived interest in TV shows in the past two years or so. One show I'm really into is Game of Thrones (yes, I know, everybody is in to it too). I'm waiting (with bated breath) for the eighth season to come out; but who isn't, right? I also watch Ballers (I'm almost caught up, so no spoilers!). As for non-HBO shows, I watch Burn Notice (the one with Jeffrey Donovan and Gabrielle Anwar) and Life (starring Damian Lewis and Adam Arkin).</p>
    <p id="limit">I also enjoying going to the theater to watch new movies, but I'm a poor college student so that doesn't happen as often as I'd like. I did go and see <i>Geostorm</i> recently. It was decent. Not quite what I expected, but definitely a good watch.</p>
    <h4>Exercising</h4>
    <p id="limit">I've always had a love for exercising. Since for as long as I can remember, I have loved to get up and work my body. Whether it's hitting the gym, swimming, running, or hiking I love it! I mostly do bodyweight exercises now, because I don't have as much time as I used to.</p>
    <h4>Computers</h4>
    <p id="limit">Computers are also one of my passions. Ever since I was old enough to be on a computer I've been tinkering around on them. I had a friend ask me one time where I learned what to do to fix a problem he had. I told him he wouldn't believe me. My secret: I just played around trying to fix things/cause problems intentionally.</p>
    <h4>Promotions</h4>
    <p id="limit">I don't normally promote too much on my own pages because I like to limit the ads/advertisements/etc. people see when they visit. These are some people who have really impacted me in my life, though, and I thought I'd share with all of you.</p>
