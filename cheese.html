    <h1>CHEESE!</h1>
    <p>So this page might seem fairly random just stumbling across it on my page. So let me explain. While I was at work, my coworkers and I starting talking about cheese. Next, we started telling each other our favorite types of cheese. Then we moved to looking up random cheese facts to tell each other. Weird, I know. But we're crazy college students. What do you expect? So here are some cheese facts to blow your mind!</p>
    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>We'll start of with a basic one. The word "cheese" comes from the Latin "caseus" which means "to ferment" or "to sour".</li>
      <li>A person who sells cheese is known as a "cheesemonger".</li>
      <li>The ancient Greek hero Aristaeus is credited for the discovery of feta cheese.</li>
      <li>Collecting cheese labels is called "tyrosemiophilia".</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>References</h3>
    <p>Now I'm a good student. Obviously I didn't come up with these facts all by my lonesome. Here are the places I pulled them from.</p>
