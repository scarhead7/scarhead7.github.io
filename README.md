#### my personal webpage


This repository is for my own personal website. I have a collection of a number of pages that seem random in the aggregate, but all have a personal purpose. I don't forsee me making this repository public until my voucher expires.


I moved each page to it's own subdirectory. In process of doing this, I literally broke every webpage here. The following TODOs will fix them.

**TODO:**
* ~~create the following  folders inside each subdirectory:~~
  * ~~styles~~
  * ~~scripts~~
  * ~~images~~
* ~~move images to correct folder~~
  * ~~tab icons~~
  * ~~site proper images~~
* ~~make sure all scripts resolve to correct files~~
* ~~make sure all stylesheets resolve to correct files~~
* make sure all links inside ALL webpages resolve correctly and no 404 errors result
* ~~add TV bot report to website~~
* create a custom 404 webpage (as per [Custom 404](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site/))
* update the Excel tutorial with greater detail
* check style on all pages
  * make sure all styles are in external files
